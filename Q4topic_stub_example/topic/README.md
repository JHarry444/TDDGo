# Topic Stub Example

This example demonstrates how to use a **Stub** in Go for testing the `FindHighestPerTopicFromProvider` function using the TDD approach.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Go installed.
2. Initialize the module (if not already done):

```bash
go mod init example.com/topic
go mod tidy
```

3. Run the test:

```bash
go test ./topic
```

This will test the logic using a stubbed topic provider.

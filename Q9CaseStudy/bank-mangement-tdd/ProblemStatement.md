#  Capstone Project: Bank Account Management Service (TDD + GoMock)

##  Problem Statement

Build a **Bank Account Management Service** in Go using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** and **GoMock**.

---

##  Requirements

The service should support:

1. **Account Creation**  
   - Create a new bank account with an initial balance.  

2. **Deposit Money**  
   - Add funds to an account.  

3. **Withdraw Money**  
   - Withdraw funds from an account.  
   - Prevent withdrawals when funds are insufficient.  

4. **Check Balance**  
   - Retrieve the current account balance.  

5. **Transaction Logging**  
   - Log every transaction (deposit/withdrawal) through a `Logger` interface.  
   - Use **GoMock** to mock and verify logging behavior in tests.  

---

##  Key Focus Areas
- Apply the **TDD cycle**: Red → Green → Refactor.  
- Write clean and maintainable **unit tests**.  
- Use **GoMock** to simulate external dependencies.  
- Practice **refactoring and modular design**.
